            <p>Name: Bryce Petrovay</p>
            <p>Height: 6'3</p>
            <p>Weight: 160lbs</p>
            <p>Age: 21</p>
            <p>Girlfriend: Non-Existent</p>
            <p>Meet the quintessential Brummie adventurer: a proud graduate of Plantsbrook School, where he mastered the
                fine art of dodging puddles and perfecting the ‚ÄúWalsall College Smile.‚Äù With a certificate in Mechanical
                Engineering that practically screams ‚ÄúI can fix your radiator and still have time for a cheeky Nando's,‚Äù he
                recently wrapped up his full-time missionary service for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
                the wilds of Scotland and Ireland‚Äîwhere he bravely navigated the treacherous terrain of haggis and
                deep-fried everything.

                This aspiring American expatriate is on a quest to escape the drizzle of Birmingham for the sun-soaked
                shores of the States, convinced that a life of burgers and baseball is just around the corner. He dreams of
                building machines that could one day help him achieve his ultimate goal: perfectly replicating a classic
                American diner experience‚Äîcomplete with jukebox and all-you-can-eat pancakes.

                Armed with an engineering degree and an arsenal of terrible puns, he‚Äôs ready to take on the world, one fried
                food item at a time. Who knows? Maybe he‚Äôll even convince the Americans that British cuisine is more than
                just tea and biscuits. Spoiler alert: it isn‚Äôt!</p>
