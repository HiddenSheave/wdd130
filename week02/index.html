        <p>Name: Bryce Petrovay</p>
        <p>Height: 6'3</p>
        <p>Weight: 160lbs</p>
        <p>Age: 21</p>
        <p>Girlfriend: Non-Esistent</p>
        <p>Meet the quintessential Brummie adventurer: a proud graduate of Plantsbrook School, where he mastered the
            fine art of dodging puddles and perfecting the “Walsall College Smile.” With a degree in Mechanical
            Engineering that practically screams “I can fix your radiator and still have time for a cheeky Nando's,” he
            recently wrapped up his full-time missionary service for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
            the wilds of Scotland and Ireland—where he bravely navigated the treacherous terrain of haggis and
            deep-fried everything.

            This aspiring American expatriate is on a quest to escape the drizzle of Birmingham for the sun-soaked
            shores of the States, convinced that a life of burgers and baseball is just around the corner. He dreams of
            building machines that could one day help him achieve his ultimate goal: perfectly replicating a classic
            American diner experience—complete with jukebox and all-you-can-eat pancakes.

            Armed with an engineering degree and an arsenal of terrible puns, he’s ready to take on the world, one fried
            food item at a time. Who knows? Maybe he’ll even convince the Americans that British cuisine is more than
            just tea and biscuits. Spoiler alert: it isn’t!</p>
