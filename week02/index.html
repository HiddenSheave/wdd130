        <p>Name: Bryce Petrovay</p>
        <p>Height: 6'3</p>
        <p>Weight: 160lbs</p>
        <p>Age: 21</p>
        <p>Girlfriend: Non-Existent</p>
        <p>Meet the quintessential Brummie adventurer: a proud graduate of Plantsbrook School, where he mastered the
            fine art of dodging puddles and perfecting the “Walsall College Smile.” With a certificate in Mechanical
            Engineering that practically screams “I can fix your radiator and still have time for a cheeky Nando's,” he
            recently wrapped up his full-time missionary service for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
            the wilds of Scotland and Ireland—where he bravely navigated the treacherous terrain of haggis and
            deep-fried everything.

            This aspiring American expatriate is on a quest to escape the drizzle of Birmingham for the sun-soaked
            shores of the States, convinced that a life of burgers and baseball is just around the corner. He dreams of
            building machines that could one day help him achieve his ultimate goal: perfectly replicating a classic
            American diner experience—complete with jukebox and all-you-can-eat pancakes.

            Armed with an engineering degree and an arsenal of terrible puns, he’s ready to take on the world, one fried
            food item at a time. Who knows? Maybe he’ll even convince the Americans that British cuisine is more than
            just tea and biscuits. Spoiler alert: it isn’t!</p>

            <img src="images/sutton.jpeg" alt="The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield">
            <p>The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, located within the Great British Isles, is well known for its 2,400 acres of natural parkland with seven lakes, originally the property of Bishop Vesey after it was given to him by Henry VIII. Old Moor Hall, the fifteenth century home of the Bishop still stands. Originally gronuds where the King of England, Henry VIII hunted. He enjoyed his time soo much soo that he deemed the land to be Royal, hence the name given</p>
